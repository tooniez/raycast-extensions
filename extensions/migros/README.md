## Good to Know

- **No Account Required** – This extension does not connect to your Migros
  account. It uses public APIs that don't require authentication.
- **Local Favorites** – Favorites are stored locally on your Mac and are not
  synced with your Migros account or the Migros app. They are completely
  separate.
- **Preferred Store** – Your preferred store setting is also stored locally and
  is independent of any preferences in your Migros account.

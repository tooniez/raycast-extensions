## Configuration

### Data Set

By default the Data Set is set to "Minimal" which includes common symbols and only has ~5400 results. This is only a subset of the full Unicode 17 dataset.
If you cannot find the symbol you are looking for, please set this configuration to "Full" and try again. This set is +40000 symbols big and might impact performance.

> Please note that if you are using the "List view" instead of "Grid", only the "Minimal" dataset is supported due to technical reasons.
